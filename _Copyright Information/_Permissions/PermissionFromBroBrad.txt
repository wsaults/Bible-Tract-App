Bro. Brad,
 
The boys (Spencer and William – I am it too, but they are the primaries) are working on a phone app for witnessing.
It’s in the beginning stages, but they need more tracts.
 
We would like your permission to use your green/red and Spanish tracts that you have done for the church.
We would give you credit or the church. However you would like it to be done.
 
Please let me know.
 
Thanks.
